    "Now that you're comfortable prompting LLMs, you're going to learn how to drastically increase the amount of work you can perform with LLMs, and in an elegant way, by creating LangChain chains. At the core of LangChain chains are runnables, which are actions of work that can be composed in a variety of practical and helpful ways.\n",
