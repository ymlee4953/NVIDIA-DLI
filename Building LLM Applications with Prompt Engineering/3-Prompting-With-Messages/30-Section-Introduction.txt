# Section 3: Prompting With Messages
Thus far our interactions with our chat model have been text in text out. In this section we'll begin by exposing that behind the text are indications of the role of who is providing the text (human or AI) and will learn how to author prompts that explicitly use these and other available roles to great effect.

By the time you complete this section you will be able to employ few-shot prompting, utilize the system message to define the overarching role or persona of a chatbot, and be able to get your chat model to tackle tasks that may have otherwise been too complex for it by using a technique called chain-of-thought prompting.
