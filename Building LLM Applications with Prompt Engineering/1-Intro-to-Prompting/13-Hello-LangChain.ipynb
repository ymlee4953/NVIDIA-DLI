    "\n",
    "LangChainâ€™s simplistic architecture and abstractions let developers effortlessly replace components like language models, prompt, and processing steps, with little modification. In addition, LangChain provides a consistent, unified interface across multiple LLMs from different providers, simplifying interactions and allowing developers to concentrate on application development rather than dealing with model-specific complexities.\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to use LangChain with our locally-hosted model, we need to utilize a Framework Connector which ultimately converts an arbitrary API from its core into one that a target code-base would expect. We can do this by utilizing `ChatNVIDIA` class within `langchain-nvidia-ai-endpoints` package. With this tool, which uses the OpenAI API under the hood, we can start to iteratively develop and test out prompts more efficiently, and use LangChain with our NVIDIA NIM LLMs."

When set to `0`, the LLM will always generate the text that it considers as having the highest probability of coming next. When set to higher values, it can generate text that is not necessarily what it considers to be the highest probability of coming next therefore introducing randomness and a sense of creativity in its generations.\n",
