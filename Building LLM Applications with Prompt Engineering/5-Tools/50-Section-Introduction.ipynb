    "LLMs are capable to identify when an application ought to utilize functionality external to the LLM itself, and, how that external functionality ought to be invoked. Such components of functionality external to the LLM are referred to as tools, and the paradigm by which our LLM-applications identify when and how to use tools is called agents.\n",

    "Tool use and agents are a huge topic in their own right, but in this section we'd like to give you an introduction to their use in the context of LLM applications. By the time you complete this section you be able to create tools, as well as simple agents that can integrate their use into your LLM-based chains."
